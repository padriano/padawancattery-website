				<li>About: Padmé Amidala was a courageous, hopeful leader, serving as Queen and then Senator of Naboo -- and was also handy with a blaster. Despite her ideals and all she did for the cause of peace, her secret, forbidden marriage to Jedi Anakin Skywalker would prove to have dire consequences for the galaxy.</li>

			<h3>Padawan Adi Gallia</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="one_half last" style="text-align: left;">
			<ul>
				<li>Gender: Female</li>
				<li>EMS: NFO a 09 24 / Blue tabby spotted with white</li>

				<li>About: Jedi Master Adi Gallia was a member of the Order's High Council during the Clone Wars. Stern and focused, she would remark upon the more outrageous tactics carried out by Anakin Skywalker or Obi-Wan Kenobi in the course of the war, but would rarely condemn their effective actions. Though not as brash as Anakin, Adi Gallia was known to be an aggressive warrior who had no problem bringing the fight to the enemy.</li>

			<h3>Padawan Alderaan</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="one_half last" style="text-align: left;">
			<ul>
				<li>Gender: Male</li>
				<li>EMS: NFO a(s) 03 24 / Blue tabby spotted bicolour</li>

				<li>About: A peaceful world, Alderaan was bereft of weaponry in an era of galactic strife. It was not without spirit, however. Alderaan was one of the earliest supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of Rebel activity, and Grand Moff Tarkin targeted the beautiful world for reprisal as soon as the Death Star was operational.</li>

				<li>About: Discovered as a slave on Tatooine by Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker had the potential to become one of the most powerful Jedi ever, and was believed by some to be the prophesied Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. A hero of the Clone Wars, Anakin was caring and compassionate, but also had a fear of loss that would prove to be his downfall.</li>
