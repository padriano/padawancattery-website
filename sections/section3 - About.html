	<h3>The Cattery</h3>

	<p class="text-left">We are Alexandra and Nuno, a young portuguese couple which moved in 2014 to London, but we already see ourselves as londoners.</p>

	<p class="text-left">Our cattery Padawan is registered with Felis Britannica, the British branch of FIFe (Fédération Internationale Féline), and full members of the Viking Cat Club.</p>

	<p class="text-left">Our goal is to have a small amateur Norwegian Forest Cat (NFO) cattery where all cats are members of our family during all their lives. We want to contribute to the maintenance of this wonderful breed having healthy, well tempered cats, respecting the FIFe standard and the mother nature where they come from.</p>

	<p class="text-left">To achieve this, we show our cats in FIFe shows, to family and friends, and we monitor our cats health with veterinary check up and regular tests in renowned institutions.</p>

	<h3>Why Padawan</h3>

	<p class="text-left">We are young, we are always learning and we want always to continue to do it so.
We are also movie and TV series fans. Star Wars is one of our favorite and in the Star Wars world the Padawan is the apprentice that one day will become a Jedi (the good side of the force).</p>

	<p class="text-left">Our logo represents the Norwegian Forest Cat look with our cattery name joined by a Jedi light saiber. Thanks to Ana and Nelson for creating us this logo that we love.</p>

	<h3>Our history</h3>

	<p class="text-left">Throughout our lives we had dogs and Alexandra's parents has free roaming cats in their house in the countryside. Nuno already knew this amazing breed but he never had the chance to have one of this little fellows. For Alexandra it was an all new world!</p>

	<p class="text-left">In 2013 by the time of Alexandra's birthday, Nuno decided that her gift would be something totally different and probably you already know which birthday gift Nuno was thinking about... a Norwegian Forest Cat.</p>

	<p class="text-left">However, a gift like this is a big step, it is something totally new with big responsabilities. For Nuno was absolutely crucial sharing the idea with Alexandra and see what she had to say about it.</p>

	<p class="text-left">In the beggining, Alexandra said "I don't know this breed... I don't know nothing about them... Do you think that I will be able to look after a cat?" Nuno decided to show some photos and for Alexandra this cats have a really deep wild look and she felt a little bit scared. Fortunately, Nuno has a friend who has two amazing NFO and they are absolutely beautiful, with a fantastic temper. At the end of our visit to our friends Alexandra was in love with those cats. This friend isn't a breeder but he really love this breed and told us a little bit of the characteristics of them.</p>

	<p class="text-left">After that during one week Alexandra started look for more information about NFO, about things they need to have a wonderful life and after that the decision was taken. We started looking and visiting breeders until we saw Yoda at Célia Viseu Santos place and Yoda chose us to be our pet.</p>

	<p class="text-left">We continued to meet other owners/breeders and our desire to learn more didn't stop growing that lead to our second NFO, the founding queen of our cattery, Lothiriel from Ana Manessiez and Emílio Travanca.</p>

	<p class="text-left">When we moved to UK we were fortunate to continue finding other breeders and make new good friends.</p>
