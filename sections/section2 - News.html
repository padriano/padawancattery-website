	<br>
	<p>Good news!<br>
	We finished our first PawPeds course G1 - Cat Ownership.<br>
	It was a very good experience to allowed us to continue our learning about cats and meet other breeders and cat owners.<br>
	This is a recognised international course where we found cat lovers from many countries and fantastic course leaders Dagny Dickens and Monika Ostrowska. We wish to all participants the best of luck.</p>
